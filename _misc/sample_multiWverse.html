<li><b><hr>(pdfPage: 62)</b><hr> THE PARADOX OF MEASUREMENT 45<br><br>existence of a Universe beyond the Solar System that is absurd, stagger-<br>ingly so, compared to what we believed before: not just one Sun, not just a<br>few thousand, but trillions of trillions, incomprehensibly far away, almost<br>of them invisible to the naked eye and ‘detectable’ (says the theory), at<br>most, by the most advanced instruments.<br><br>And to be sure, the ability of this absurd theory to explain (and not<br>merely predict) much about our solar system—the distribution of the<br>elements, the creation of the Sun—is a neat trick. But to take advantage<br>of that trick, we do not need (surely) to believe this theory, for even our<br>best scientific theory surely should be disbelieved if it claims that what we<br>hitherto regarded as the whole Universe is relegated to the smallest part<br>of an unthinkably greater reality.<br><br>The world presented to us by modern astrophysics may be small com-<br>pared to that presented to us by Everett-interpreted quantum mechanics,<br>but it is still incomprehensibly vaster than anything we can really intuit or<br>properly visualize. And yet we accept it as reality. The moral is clear: our<br>intuitions as to what is ‘unreasonable’ or ‘absurd’ were formed to aid our<br>ancestors scratching a living on the savannahs of Africa, and the Universe<br><br>is not obliged to conform to them.<br><br>CHAPTER 1. The Everett ‘interpretation’ of quantum mechanics is just<br>quantum mechanics itself, taken literally as a description of the Universe.<br>As such, it is the only solution of the quantum measurement problem<br>which is not committed either to a sea change in the goals of the scientific<br><br>enterprise or to the wholesale rewriting of our current best physics.<br><br>CHAPTER 2. Why does ‘quantum mechanics, taken literally’ entail that<br>we live in a <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span>?<br> <hr> <a href="../w/wa/WallaceEmergent2012/pages/0062.html"><i>go to the original page...</i></a> </li>
<li><b><hr>(pdfPage: 121)</b><hr> 104 FIRST INTERLUDE<br><br>Autuor: Because as I say, the Everett interpretation just is quantum<br>mechanics. If you're after some experiment to distinguish Everett-<br>interpreted quantum mechanics from an operational interpretation of<br>quantum mechanics, then sure, I haven’t got anything to offer. But<br>there’s nothing special about quantum mechanics there. I don’t know of<br>an experiment that distinguishes the theory that dinosaurs existed from<br>the ‘theory’ that dinosaurs didn’t exist but the fossils are exactly the way<br>they would have been if dinosaurs had existed.<br><br>Sceptic: Isn’t it still a bit uncomfortable for you that you're arguing that<br>all these other worlds exist but that there’s no possible way to observe<br>one of them?<br><br>Autuor: Not especially. Our best current theory of physics (a) predicts<br>that they exist and (b) explains why we can’t normally see them. (And it’s<br>just a matter of degree. Various interference experiments—the Michel-<br>son interferometer, for instance, or Shor’s algorithm—let us see the<br>many-worlds structure of the quantum state pretty directly, as I'll discuss<br>in more detail in Chapter 10.)<br><br>In any case, we see this sort of thing a lot in science. We can’t directly<br>observe a dinosaur, or a quark, or a quasar, or the interior of the sun,<br>but that doesn’t stop us taking them seriously.<br><br>Sceptic: In most of those cases, it’s just happenstance that we can’t make<br>the observation. If we were properly situated in space and time, we'd be<br>able to.<br><br>AutHor: Well, if we were properly situated in the <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span>, we'd be<br><br>able to see other worlds.<br>Sceptic: How can you know that?<br><br>AutHor: My best theory of physics tells me so. How do you know that<br>you'd be able to see dinosaurs or quasars if you were appropriately<br>situated?<br><br>Extravagance<br><br>Sceptic: The Everett interpretation wildly violates Ockham’s razor.<br><br>AutHor: Well (as I noted in Chapter 1) Ockham’s razor only requires us<br><br>not to multiply entities beyond necessity. Necessary entities are fine.<br> <hr> <a href="../w/wa/WallaceEmergent2012/pages/0121.html"><i>go to the original page...</i></a> </li>
<li><b><hr>(pdfPage: 214)</b><hr> SYMMETRY, RATIONALITY, AND THE BORN RULE _ 197<br><br>same act (knowably the same act, in fact) under a different description,<br>which obviously violates state supervenience (and, I hope, is obviously<br><br>irrational).<br><br>It is fair to note, though, that just as a non-primitive approach to<br>measurement allows one and the same physical process to count as<br>multiple abstractly construed measurements, it also allows one and the<br>same abstractly construed measurement to be performed by multiple<br>physical processes. It is then a nontrivial fact, and in a sense a physical<br>analogue of noncontextuality, that rational agents are indifferent to<br><br>which particular process realizes a given measurement.<br><br>In earlier work (Wallace 2002a; 2003b; 2007) I called this fact mea-<br>surement neutrality. It is indeed a tacit premise in Deutsch’s original<br>(1999) proof of the Born Rule, as I argued in Wallace (2003b); it was an<br>explicit premise in early versions of my proof (Wallace 2002a; 2003c).<br>Here, though, it is a theorem (a trivial corollary of the Born Rule<br>theorem, in fact) that measurement neutrality is rationally required. The<br>short answer as to why is that two acts which correspond to the same<br>abstractly construed measurement can be transformed into the same act<br>via processes to which rational agents are indifferent. To see the long<br><br>answer, reread sections 5.3—5.7.<br><br>Incidentally, Gleason’s theorem (or, more accurately, its POVM gen-<br>eralization) is much more directly needed if we wish to generalize the<br>results of this chapter to situations where the quantum state is unknown<br><br>to the agent, as we will see in Chapter 6.<br><br>CHAPTER 5. A rational agent, believing that the Everett interpretation<br>is true and that the quantum state of a given system is |), knows that<br>measurements on that state will generally split his part of the <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span><br>into multiple branches, with different measurement outcomes, and differ-<br>ent versions of the agent, on different branches; he also knows that the<br>relative weights of these branches are given by the Born Rule, applied<br>to the post-measurement state of the system and measurement device.<br>Rationality considerations not different in kind to those which apply in<br>single-universe decision making then compel the agent to act as if a set<br>of branches of relative weight w has probability w. In other words, he is<br><br>rationally required to act as if the Born Rule is true.<br> <hr> <a href="../w/wa/WallaceEmergent2012/pages/0214.html"><i>go to the original page...</i></a> </li>
<li><b><hr>(pdfPage: 269)</b><hr> 252 SECOND INTERLUDE<br><br>a probabilistic strategy is permissible, over and above showing that it<br><br>satisfies the qualitative rationality axioms.)<br><br>Rationality, evolution, and anthropic reasoning<br><br> <br><br>Sceptic: Okay: suppose, just for the sake of argument, that you can show<br>that rational agents conform to the Born Rule. It doesn’t ultimately help<br><br>unless you can explain why our branch is one where rational agents exist.<br><br>AutHor: I don’t see why quantum mechanics, any more than (say) gen-<br>eral relativity, needs to answer that question. But in any case, here<br>goes: we have a general framework, natural selection, for explaining<br>why organisms in general are adapted to their environments. The fact<br>that humans aren’t such bad approximations to rational systems can be<br>expected to be a special case of that explanation. And that explanation<br>works just as well in the Everett interpretation.<br><br>Sceptic: I’m not so sure it does, actually. Natural selection tells us that we<br>should expect to find organisms adapted to their environments in all but<br>a very low-weight collection of branches. But why shouldn’t our branch<br>be one of those low-weight branches?<br><br>AutHor: Because the decision-theoretic representation theorems tell us<br>(roughly) that we should reject hypotheses according to which our own<br>branch has a low weight.<br><br>Sceptic: This brings up something that’s bothered me throughout. In this<br>case, just like all your other decision-theoretic cases, you’re construing<br>the problem as one about how we accept and reject hypotheses as data<br>comes in. That’s fine in a non-branching framework. But the whole epis-<br>temic game is different in the Everett interpretation, isn’t it? It becomes<br>a case of anthropic reasoning:> where in the branching <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span> am I?<br>(Or, equivalently: which of the myriad qualitatively identical Sceptics am<br>I?) That doesn’t seem to show up at all in this decision-theoretic edifice<br><br>you've created.<br><br>3 Here the sceptic uses ‘anthropic reasoning’ in the physicists’ sense, to mean any reasoning<br>about the location of the observer in physical reality. Philosophers tend to use the term more<br>narrowly: they should read ‘anthropic reasoning’ as ‘reasoning about self-location’.<br> <hr> <a href="../w/wa/WallaceEmergent2012/pages/0269.html"><i>go to the original page...</i></a> </li>
<li><b><hr>(pdfPage: 342)</b><hr> THE DIRECTIONS OF BRANCHING AND TIME = 325<br><br>‘branching’ given in sections 3.8 and 3.9 should make this clear; by the<br>branching-decoherence theorem, it follows that except in the trivial case<br>of macroscopic determinism, ifa set of histories is decoherent then its time<br>reverse is not.)<br><br>For this reason, there is a momentary temptation to suppose that<br>quantum mechanics builds in some arrow of time at the base level. But<br>ultimately, the Schrédinger equation remains essentially~ time-symmetric.<br>The direction of time in the branching structure does not reflect any<br>underlying asymmetry in the microdynamics: it is an emergent, not a<br>fundamental, asymmetry.<br><br>This leaves the question, though, of where that emergent asymmetry<br>comes from. Almost by definition, if'a higher-level time-asymmetric state<br>of affairs comes about despite time-symmetry at the fundamental level, it<br>must be due to some asymmetry in the boundary conditions; but it is not<br>prima facie clear where any such asymmetry was smuggled into Chapter 3’s<br>discussion of the dynamical processes that give rise to branching.<br><br>Put like this, the problem may start to sound familiar. Microdynamical<br>time-reversibility, macrolevel irreversibility, appeal to special boundary<br>conditions ...this is, of course, the familiar problem of how irreversible<br>thermodynamic processes can be understood consistent with a lack of<br>irreversibility at the microscopic level.<br><br>In an ideal world, then, the strategy would be clear: look at the accepted<br>explanations for thermodynamic irreversibility and see whether they apply<br>to decoherent branching. There would be three basic possibilities: either<br>the exact same conditions that lead to other irreversibilities also lead to<br>branching; or some analogous approach can be taken to making sense of<br>branching; or the two phenomena are actually quite different.<br><br>But this particular branch of the <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span>, unfortunately, is not an ideal<br>world. In fact, the foundations of statistical mechanics are if anything in<br>more disarray than the philosophy of quantum mechanics. So to get clearer<br>on why branching occurs, I will need to take an extended detour into<br>the philosophy of statistical mechanics, in order to say something about<br>not just Everettian variants of irreversibility, but macrolevel irreversibility<br><br>in general. This will be the subject of this chapter: its conclusion is<br><br>2 . . . . .<br><br>2 That is, putting aside CP violation in particle physics, which (a) appears very small,<br>and (b) much more importantly, just requires us to replace ‘time-symmetric’ with ‘CPT-<br>symmetric’, with no significant consequences.<br> <hr> <a href="../w/wa/WallaceEmergent2012/pages/0342.html"><i>go to the original page...</i></a> </li>

(For an<br>introduction to this subject, see Carr 2007.)<br><br>In fact, the Everettian <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span> is rather well behaved and well under-<br>stood compared to some which have been postulated. The mere postu-<br>lation of a vast multiplicity of Universes, and a probability distribution<br>across them, with no justification other than the desire to explain certain<br>features of the dynamical laws, feels (rightly or wrongly) rather tenuous<br>as a piece of scientific reasoning, and rather painfully removed from<br>empirical confirmation. By contrast, in Everettian quantum mechanics<br>we have a rather precisely constrained theory of a <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span>, generating<br>detailed—and thoroughly confirmed—predictions, and arguably allowing<br>us to directly detect multiple Universes in certain cases (see section 10.3).<br>For instance, it is not infrequently suggested that the value of the charge<br>on the electron?’ —which appears (Barrow and Tipler 1986: 288-366) to<br>be fairly tightly constrained by the existence of life—can be understood by<br>postulating a <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span> in which it takes all conceivable values, and noting<br>that most of them are barren of life.* To make such a story work using an<br>Everettian <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span>, we would require some underlying quantum theory<br>in which the charge of the electron was dynamically determined in such a<br>way as to take different values in different branches; such a theory would,<br>presumably, make other concrete and testable predictions. (Note that<br>our current best theory of electromagnetism, the Standard Model, does<br>not have this feature: the electron charge is dynamically determined (via<br>spontaneous symmetry breaking) but its value is branch-independent.? All<br><br>this suggests that—if anthropic reasoning can be made sense of at all in a<br><br>© So far as I am aware, Bostrom (2002) is the only sustained attempt at developing such a<br>systematic theory.<br><br>7 To be strictly accurate, one should talk about the dimensionless fine structure constant,<br>not the unit-dependent electron charge per se.<br><br>8 The issue actually has some cultural and political relevance: the smarter proponents<br>of the argument that God designed the Universe (e.g. Stannard 1993; Polkinghorne 1986)<br>appeal not to biology but to the fine-tuning of the constants of nature so as to make their<br><br> <br><br>point.

There was no<br>suitable way to squeeze this historical dead end into that<br>book, but it reminded me that Schrédinger was a man of<br>many talents, and well worth being the subject of a popular<br>biography—a biography which would give me a chance to dust<br>down that forgotten piece of work and give it the recognition<br>it deserves, set in the context of Schrédinger’s life and work.<br>The more I looked into his life, the more remarkable it<br>seemed; I hope you agree that his is very much a story worth<br>telling.<br><br>x<br> <hr> <a href="../g/gr/GribbinErwin2012/pages/0013.html"><i>go to the original page...</i></a> </li>

This is the<br>development of the quantum computer, a practical proposition<br>as “unbelievable,” in the sense used by John Bell that day in<br>Oxford, as any development in the application of science to<br>technology.<br><br>‘The quantum computer and the <span class='searchResult'>Multiverse</span><br><br>I have described the background to the development of<br>quantum computers in detail in my book In Search of the<br><span class='searchResult'>Multiverse</span>, but the mind-blowing implications can be understood<br>without going into the nuts and bolts of the quantum<br>engineering. The essence of modern electronic computers is<br>that they carry out calculations using binary code, which can<br>be represented as a string of 0s and 1s, or in practical terms as<br>an array of switches which can be either on or off. Each<br>“on/off” unit is called a bit. Eight bits make a byte, and<br>the power of a computer is often expressed in terms of the<br>number of bytes in its “brain”—these days, many gigabytes in<br>even a modest laptop or smart phone. The essence of a<br>quantum computer is that each of the switches—each bit—<br>can exist in a superposition of states, without any collapse of<br>the wave function, so that it is both on and off (storing both 1<br>and 0) at the same time. Crucially, such switches (or “stores”)<br>can also be entangled, so that a pair of these so-called qubits<br>may be guaranteed to be either both in the state 1 or both in<br>the state 0, even though neither of the qubits can be said to be<br>definitely in the state 0 or definitely in the state 1. In principle,<br>each qubit could be a single atom or a polarized photon; as<br>yet, in practice molecules containing several atoms are used,<br>and each bit of information is stored in billions of copies of<br>each molecule.<br><br>278<br> <hr> <a href="../g/gr/GribbinErwin2012/pages/0292.html"><i>go to the original page...</i></a> </li>
<li><b><hr>(pdfPage: 294)</b><hr> c14.qxd<br><br>2/26/13 5:43 PM Page 280 ©<br><br>SCHRODINGER AND THE QUANTUM REVOLUTION<br><br>David Deutsch, who is a pioneer of the theory of quantum<br>computation, has asked: Where do the calculations carried out<br>on a quantum computer take place? Remember that there is no<br>collapse of the wave function, exactly like the situation in the<br>Schrédinger’s cat thought experiment before the box is opened.<br>So both possibilities are real. If a quantum computer using 8<br>qubits is equivalent to a conventional computer using 256 bits,<br>that is because there are 256 separate computers corresponding<br>to each possible quantum state of the processor carrying out the<br>computation in 256 different universes—the “parallel worlds”<br>of science fiction. They work on the problem together, solve it,<br>and share the answer. “That’s what the laws of physics tell us,”<br>says Deutsch. “It can’t be that there are multiple universes at the<br>level of atoms but only a single universe at the level of cats.”"<br><br>This does not mean that the Universe somehow “splits”<br>into—in this case—256 copies of itself when you run<br>the computer. The <span class='searchResult'>Multiverse</span> idea says that there always were<br>256 universes, identical to one another up to the point where<br>the computation is run, and that the identical experimenters<br>in each of those universes each decide to carry out the same<br>experiment—hardly surprising, since they are identical. And<br>this “no collapse” picture is very close to what Schrédinger<br>suggested in 1952 (see Chapter 11), although what became<br>known as the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWIJ) of quantum<br>mechanics is usually credited to the American physicist<br>Hugh Everett (1930-82), who proposed it a few years<br>later; he was unaware of Schrédinger’s earlier work, and<br>(unfortunately) did see the MWI in terms of the repeated<br>“splitting” of reality into different branches. In my view, the<br>most important thing to take away from the concept of<br>the <span class='searchResult'>Multiverse</span>, which is the only satisfactory way to explain<br><br>280<br> <hr> <a href="../g/gr/GribbinErwin2012/pages/0294.html"><i>go to the original page...</i></a> </li>

<li><b><hr>(pdfPage: 253)</b><hr> 244 Hollyweird Science<br><br>In science the definition of “universe” has not only changed over time, but<br>the definition depends upon the discipline of the scientist using the term.<br>Three centuries ago, the “universe” was everything—all that there is. That was<br>when the stars of the Milky Way were thought to be the sum total of the Uni-<br>verse, though. When astronomer William Herschel performed a more detailed<br>survey of the fuzzy patches of light in the sky, of many of the same objects sur-<br>veyed earlier by Messier but at greater magnification, he observed that some<br>revealed a spiral structure. It was philosopher Immanuel Kant who called these<br>island universes (recall the great distance to these objects was confirmed by<br>Edwin Hubble in the 1920s). Since the “universe” was intended to reflect all<br>there is, “island universes” quickly fell out of favor, to be replaced by “galaxy.”<br><br>Nowadays, universe has come to mean “the sphere of influence encircled by<br>the effects of the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago” to astronomers, but to theo-<br>retical physicists, universe has a different meaning, even potentially multiple<br>meanings. Discoveries in theoretical physics suggest that there might exist<br>other universes, parallel to ours, that we can not observe through a telescope.<br>There might even be multitudes of alternate realities spawned from our own<br>every moment. With its scope as “all there is” superseded, new terms came<br>into being to describe the collection of all potential universes—the most com-<br>mon of which is <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span>.<br><br>There are many of us thinking of one version of parallel universe theory or an-<br>other. If it’s all a lot of nonsense, then it’s a lot of wasted effort going into this far-<br><br>out idea. But if this idea is correct, it is a fantastic upheaval in our understanding.<br><br>Brian Greene, Theoretical Physicist, Author, Zhe Elegant Universe<br><br> <br><br>Two prominent theoretical physicists—Max Tegmark from MIT and Brian<br>Greene from Columbia—have categorized the different types of parallel uni-<br>verses that could theoretically exist, with Greene’s nine models being a super-<br>set of Tegmark’s four (and a superset of the types of universe that have been<br>portrayed on both big and little screens).<br><br>In some of the universes that these physicists describe either the physical<br>laws or fundamental physical constants are different than those in our Uni-<br>verse. While interesting from an intellectual standpoint, universes where the<br>physical laws vary significantly from ours are, in general, dramatically unin-<br>teresting in a fictional narrative: a universe that is so fundamentally alien that<br>an audience can barely comprehend it, if at all, hardly wins high the “relat-<br>ibility” category.<br><br>If there are parallel universes, would we ever be able to detect them? Travel<br>to them? For some <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span> models, the surprising answer is, “Yes. To both.”<br> <hr> <a href="../g/gr/GrazierHollyweird2015/pages/0253.html"><i>go to the original page...</i></a> </li>

Barrow asked, “What we might expect to<br>see if we made scientific observations from within a simulated reality?” Bar-<br>row suggested that an imperfect virtual reality simulation would contain ob-<br>servable glitches or errors. When Pixar simulates a scene in a story, complete<br>with reflections from water, mirrors, or windows, they don’t start with Max-<br>well’s equations of electromagnetism, but make simplifications along the way<br>to save on memory and processing requirements. Barrow’s approach takes it<br>that for the overwhelming majority of the time, these simplifications are good<br>enough, but ever so often, there might be observable momentary glitches.<br>There might also be smaller errors, unnoticeable at first, that accumulate over<br>time to the point where they do create observable errors. Simulation errors<br>might require periodic software patches, which might manifest as disconti-<br>nuities in reality (a la when the rebels in The Matrix spot the same cat walking<br>past them in the same way twice). Much of Barrow’s writing was the basis of<br>the 2012 Eureka episode “Force Quit.”<br><br>The universe is big, it’s vast, and complicated, and ridiculous. And sometimes,<br><br>very rarely, impossible things just happen and we call them miracles.<br><br> <br><br>The Doctor, Doctor Who, “The Pandorica Opens”<br><br> <br><br>In 2012, the simulation model gained renewed attention when physi-<br>cists indentified specific physical observations that could determine if we<br>exist within a simulation (that is, they acknowledged, if we were not pre-<br>programmed never to discover the true nature of our existence). In a natural<br>universe, the expected distribution of cosmic rays—high-energy subatomic<br>particles radiated from some astronomical phenomena—would be isotropic,<br>or equally-likely to come from any direction. If we lived within a simulation<br>that was gridded, i.e., positions were quantized or pixilated, then cosmic rays<br>would be strongly biased along orthogonal (perpendicular) directions.<br><br>The argument is not without its logical flaws, but it does incite interest-<br>ing lunch-time conversations.

In theory, if you could travel fast enough, and outpace the<br>“stretchiness” of the space of your local universe, you could travel to another<br>Hubble volume. In the brane (short for membrane) <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span> model, on<br>the other hand, each universe is one of many coexisting four-dimensional<br>volumes immersed within a higher-dimensional space called the bulk. Each<br>brane is disconnected from the others, and matter is bound to its brane’.<br>While universes in the quilted model are like blobs of wax floating within a<br>lava lamp, brane universes are like drawings on different pages of a book—<br>you cant go from one picture to another, although in the science fiction com-<br>edy web series Other Space (2015-) a “tear” between membranes strands a<br>luckless spaceship crew in another universe.<br><br>Surprisingly, physicists are devising experiments to determine if this model<br>reflects reality. In an interview with NPR®, Greene says:<br><br>If we are living on one of these giant membranes, then the following can hap-<br>pen: When you slam particles together—which is what happens at the LHC—<br>some debris from those collisions can be ejected off of our membrane and be<br>ejected into the greater cosmos in which our membrane floats. If that happens,<br>that debris will take away some energy. So if we measure the amount of en-<br>ergy just before the protons collide and compare it with the amount of energy<br>just after they collide, if there’s a little less after—and it’s less in just the right<br>way—it would indicate that some had flown off, indicating that this mem-<br>brane picture is correct.<br><br>Not only is there is no guarantee that the physical laws that prevail in our<br>universe are the same as those in the bulk, there is no guarantee that the physi-<br>cal laws of our Universe rule in other universes (which is the thinking behind<br>Tegmark’s Level-II Universes and some of Greene’s parallel universe models<br>we will overlook here). There is certainly no guarantee that there is another<br>“you” (or a multitude of “yous”) existing within separate branes in this mod-<br>el—though, if the universes were old enough, and matter distributed evenly<br>enough, by the same argument for an alternate “you” in the quilted universe,<br>there is very likely another “you” on another brane (Fig. 10.2).<br><br>Popular in 1960s’ and 1970s’ science fiction was a concept called the Fifth<br>Dimension. In some instances, the concept referred simply to an unexplored<br>or strange parallel realm. It others it is an extra dimensionality to the universe<br><br>’ Though gravity might not be. Some physicists are entertaining the notion that gravity “leaks” off of the<br>brane of its origin to the bulk or nearby branes. This might explain why gravity is so much weaker than<br>the other three fundamental forces, i.e., why a cheap fridge magnet can hold up a piece of paper against<br>the gravitational force generated by an entire planet.<br><br>* hetp://www.npr.org/2011/01/24/132932268/a-physicist-explains-why-parallel-universes-may-exist.<br> <hr> <a href="../g/gr/GrazierHollyweird2015/pages/0258.html"><i>go to the original page...</i></a> </li>

One might also argue that the fifth dimension is the bulk, the<br>higher-dimensional space in which our spacetime is immersed. In the 2009<br>alternate reality episode of Eureka entitled “Insane in the p-Brane,” the term<br>“fifth dimension” is used synonymously as the “theoretical membrane barrier<br>between dimensions’; in other words, the bulk.<br><br>There is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man.

We discussed in Chapter Nine how time travel is frequently depicted<br>as chaotic: go back in time, sneeze at the wrong time, and humanity first<br>lands on the Moon in 1985. One way this extreme sensitivity might readily<br>be explained, even expected, is that if the quantum universe model is correct,<br>and, at each moment, multitudes of realities come into existence as a result of<br>“decisions” at the quantum level.<br><br>If there is a quantum <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span>, then as time travelers journey backwards<br>in time, the ever-branching tree of quantum probabilities would, instead,<br>merge like tributaries of a river. Moving forward again, not only would it be<br>reasonable that you might not take the same path forward, it could be argued<br>that it is impossible for you to take the same path since the introduction of<br>you, traveling companions, and whatever time machine you employ, have al-<br>tered this reality.

There is also nothing preclud-<br>ing a quantum <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span> existing and evolving within each brane or Hubble<br>volume. That the <span class='searchResult'>multiverse</span> may be a hybrid of all possible parallel universes<br>is the basis for Tegmark’s Level-IV Universe and Greene’s Ultimate Ensemble.<br><br>In the quilted and brane universe models, traveling from one universe to<br>another may involve traveling many times faster than light, or “tunneling”<br>through some interstitial realm like the bulk (cf the Dalek Void Ship in the<br>2006 “Army of Ghosts” episode of Doctor Who). How does one travel from<br>one reality to another in a quantum universe, when what lies between “here”<br>and “there” is not a vast distance or a physical barrier, but the outcome of a<br>quantum event in the past? The best science fiction answer to this would be<br>to travel backwards in time—in that instance timelines converge rather than<br>diverge, then move forward again along a different quantum path. Choosing<br>which path, though, would be highly problematic.<br><br>In the novel, and 2003 film, Timeline, Michael Crichton reversed these<br>notions. The novel was based upon the premise that there might be nearby<br>branes where history mirrors our own, but with an offset in time. Researchers<br>used this device to travel to 14th-century France. So rather than using travel<br>backwards in time to visit alternate quantum universes, Crichton relied upon<br>travel to a hybrid model universe to implement what amounted to time travel.<br><br>Parallel universes depicted in fictional narratives are most often portrayed as<br>a hybrid between either a quilted universe or a brane universe and a quantum<br>universe, and several television series have made substantive attempts to grap-<br>ple with the notion of parallel universes of this nature.

Rather than just being<br>played for comic effect, the alternate versions of the core characters of Olivia<br>Dunham and Walter Bishop—dubbed Fauxlivia and Walternate—became<br>almost as prominent and well-characterized as those from this Universe, as<br>the consequences of connecting two divergent realities played out on scales<br>ranging from the personal to the cosmic.<br><br>The mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.<br><br>Frank Herbert Dune<br><br> <br> <hr> <a href="../g/gr/GrazierHollyweird2015/pages/0263.html"><i>go to the original page...</i></a> </li>
